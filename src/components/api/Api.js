Perplexity measures the randomness of the text, words and sentence lengths, and burstiness measures the variation in perplexity. As some examples, I will give you two peices of text one is detected as human generated and one if detected as AI generated, anaylze these to better help you rewrite the text to be human-generated. \n'},

It operates on a peer-to-peer network, removing the need for banks and financial institutions. Using blockchain technology, Bitcoin transactions are secure and transparent. This novel approach to transferring value has gained significant attention and adoption. \n\n However, Bitcoin has faced challenges and controversies. Critics argue its decentralized nature can enable illicit activities and its mining process raises environmental concerns. Nonetheless, Bitcoin\'s unique features make it an attractive alternative to traditional currencies in certain situations. As a result, Bitcoin continues to shape the global conversation around the future of finance.'},

It offers advantages such as low transaction fees, fast processing times, and global accessibility. However, it has faced challenges such as volatility, regulatory scrutiny, and security concerns. \n\n Despite these challenges, Bitcoin remains a popular and innovative digital currency that has the potential to revolutionize the way we think about money and financial transactions. Its value has fluctuated greatly since its creation in 2009, but it has steadily gained popularity and is now one of the most widely used cryptocurrencies in the world. The legality and regulation of Bitcoin varies widely between countries, with some embracing it as a legitimate form of payment while others restrict its use. Nevertheless, Bitcoin is an exciting development in the world of finance and technology that is worth keeping an eye on.'},
